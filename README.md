Want a better and shorter console? Well you have come to the right place! But this package is only made for testing purposes and not actually a fully functional or complete package.
We recommend to declare a btrconsole require with the following:
1. const bc = require('btrconsole')
2. const c = require('btrconsole')
3. const btrconsole = require('btrconsole') // Deafult
4. const cons = require('btrconsole')
